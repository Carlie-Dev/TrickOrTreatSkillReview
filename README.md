# TrickOrTreatSkillReview
This is a short skill test from my java class. It asks the user their name and what they dressed up for halloween as, then it asks them how many houses they wish to trick or treat at. 
The program will then print random encounters for each house- either a random number of treats between 1-5 or a one of 5 tricks.
